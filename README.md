### Project Overview
---

This project provide an easy way to collect data from reviews in GoodReads (the most famous webpage where lectors share their books reviews'). Also there is a short analysis of the data (text).

### Data Sources

Now I'll use the reviews of my favourite novel: "Letter from a Unknown Woman" of Stefan Zweig (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50494784/reviews) published in 1922. 

### Tools

 - Python: Webscraping, Data Cleaning, Sentimental Analysis

### Webscraping

The details about this process are available in the .ipynb file

### Data Analysis

Data Analysis involved exploring the data to answer some questions, such as:

- What are the most common words used in reviews?
- Are neutral the reviews from the page?
- What about the evolution of the score from readers during the time?

### Results/Findings

1. The general word cloud demonstrates that readers engage deeply with the emotional and psychological aspects of the novella, especially the tragic, lifelong obsession of the woman and the obliviousness of the man. The shortness of the work, combined with its emotional impact, is also a key takeaway:

"Love" and "life" dominate the cloud, reinforcing the focus on lifelong love and devotion. The persistent emotional weight of unrequited love over a lifetime is clearly a central theme that resonates with readers.

Also the presence of "beautiful" and "sad" suggest that the novella is widely regarded as both beautifully written and deeply sad. Readers seem to appreciate Zweigâ€™s ability to craft a work that is aesthetically pleasing while also tragic in nature.

2. The sentiments involved in the reviews show that most of them are neutral although there are more positive than negative sentiments.

3. The score from readers among the time has been too variable until 2022 where scores started to be between 4 and 5 (the best score).
