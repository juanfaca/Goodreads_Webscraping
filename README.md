### Project Overview
---

This project provide an easy way to collect data from reviews in GoodReads (the most famous webpage where lectors share their books reviews'). Also there is a short analysis of the data (text).

### Data Sources

Now I'll use the reviews of my favourite novel: "Letter from a Unknown Woman" of Stefan Zweig (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50494784/reviews) published in 1922. 

### Tools

 - Python: Webscraping, Data Cleaning, Sentimental Analysis

### Webscraping

The details about this process are available in the .ipynb file

### Text Analysis

Text Analysis involved exploring the data to answer some questions, such as:

- What are the most common words used in reviews?
- Are neutral the reviews from the page?
- What about the evolution of the sentiments involved in reviews during the time?

### Results/Findings
